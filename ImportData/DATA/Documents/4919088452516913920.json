My approach is that the recipient of the goods also benefits from this. \r\nThis platform offers private landing pads for the delivery of parcels, food, medicines or the like. The platform sees itself as an intermediary between the provider (such as Amazon, Otto, etc.) and the recipient of the goods. Both we and the recipient benefit from this. The providers in turn get a huge network of landing sites. The model is similar to AirBnb\r\n\r\n","problemYouAreSolving":"Shorten delivery times for goods of all kinds","productDescription":"landing spot plattform for potential commercial suppliers and become part of the new future of delivery business","whatMakesYourProductUnique":"To my knowledge, this service does not yet exist in the world","productReadiness":"Draft status","productRoadMap":"Building an ecosystem around the platform e.g. boxes for package pickup including landing pad or drone pilots service delivering packages","targetMarket":["United States","Afghanistan","Albania","Algeria","American Samoa","Andorra","Angola","Anguilla","Antigua and Barbuda","Argentina","Armenia","Aruba","Australia","Austria","Azerbaijan","The Bahamas","Bahrain","Bangladesh","Barbados","Belarus","Belgium","Belize","Benin","Bermuda","Bhutan","Bolivia","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Botswana","Brazil","Brunei","Bulgaria","Burkina Faso","Burundi","Cambodia","Cameroon","Canada","Cape Verde","Cayman Islands","Central African Republic","Chad","Chile","China","Christmas Island","Cocos (Keeling) Islands","Colombia","Comoros","Congo","Cook Islands","Costa Rica","Cote d'Ivoire","Croatia","Cuba","Curacao","Cyprus","Czech Republic","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Denmark","Djibouti","Dominica","Dominican Republic","Ecuador","Egypt","El Salvador","Equatorial Guinea","Eritrea","Estonia","Ethiopia","Falkland Islands","Faroe Islands","Fiji","Finland","France","French Polynesia","Gabon","The Gambia","Georgia","Germany","Ghana","Gibraltar","Greece","Greenland","Grenada","Guadeloupe","Guam","Guatemala","Guernsey","Guinea","Guinea-Bissau","Guyana","Haiti","Honduras","Hong Kong","Hungary","Iceland","India","Indonesia","Iran","Iraq","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Jamaica","Japan","Jersey","Jordan","Kazakhstan","Kenya","Kiribati","North Korea","South Korea","Kosovo","Kuwait","Kyrgyzstan","Laos","Latvia","Lebanon","Lesotho","Liberia","Libya","Liechtenstein","Lithuania","Luxembourg","Macau","Macedonia","Madagascar","Malawi","Malaysia","Maldives","Mali","Malta","Marshall Islands","Martinique","Mauritania","Mauritius","Mayotte","Mexico","Micronesia","Moldova","Monaco","Mongolia","Montenegro","Montserrat","Morocco","Mozambique","Myanmar","Nagorno-Karabakh","Namibia","Nauru","Nepal","Netherlands","Netherlands Antilles","New Caledonia","New Zealand","Nicaragua","Niger","Nigeria","Niue","Norfolk Island","Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus","Northern Mariana","Norway","Oman","Pakistan","Palau","Palestine","Panama","Papua New Guinea","Paraguay","Peru","Philippines","Pitcairn Islands","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Qatar","Republic of the Congo","Romania","Russia","Rwanda","Saint Barthelemy","Saint Helena","Saint Kitts and Nevis","Saint Lucia","Saint Martin","Saint Pierre and Miquelon","Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","Samoa","San Marino","Sao Tome and Principe","Saudi Arabia","Senegal","Serbia","Seychelles","Sierra Leone","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","Solomon Islands","Somalia","Somaliland","South Africa","South Ossetia","South Sudan","Spain","Sri Lanka","Sudan","Suriname","Svalbard","eSwatini","Sweden","Switzerland","Syria","Taiwan","Tajikistan","Tanzania","Thailand","Timor-Leste","Togo","Tokelau","Tonga","Transnistria Pridnestrovie","Trinidad and Tobago","Tristan da Cunha","Tunisia","Turkey","Turkmenistan","Turks and Caicos Islands","Tuvalu","Uganda","Ukraine","United Arab Emirates","United Kingdom","Uruguay","Uzbekistan","Vanuatu","Vatican City","Venezuela","Vietnam","British Virgin Islands","Isle of Man","US Virgin Islands","Wallis and Futuna","Western Sahara","Yemen","Zambia","Zimbabwe"],"marketDrivers":"Challenges: Different legal requirements in the countries\r\n\r\nMarket driver:\r\nCustomer want to get their goods delivered faster and faster\r\nDeliveries with drones are much cheaper and also more environmentally friendly\r\nDrones do not get stuck in traffic and can deliver goods more reliably","marketSize":"Worldwide 330Mrd â‚¬ in 2019 ","competition":"All the big logistics companies like DHL, UPS etc and of course Amazon or Google","strengthAgainstCompetitors":"Still unknown, small and very flexible to customer needs","challengesAgainstCompetitors":"My motto, think big","revenueSources":"Brokerage fee for each delivered item","salesStrategy":"Partnerships with large logistics companies or also e.g. Lieferando\r\n\r\nDifferent pricing models:\r\nper package (fixed or percentage of the value of goods)\r\nper landing site (daily, monthly, yearly)  ","traction":"social media\r\npress\r\nHamburg Award or other startups events worldwide","pilotsCustomers":"At the moment the platform is under construction.
