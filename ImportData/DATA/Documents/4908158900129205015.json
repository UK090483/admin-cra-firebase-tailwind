Implementing roaming across networks means consumers can access all public charge-points with GreenPoint.\r\n","problemYouAreSolving":"Currently, charge-point operators only display static information such as location and power rating related to their network on their platforms. Further payment and charging are limited to membership card holders. This results in the situation that vehicles users are unable to refuel.","productDescription":"The platform provides the below value to users:  1) Location, direction and availability of Charging points on map  2) Easy and hassle free payment for charge using 2D QR code (more payment modes to follow)  3) Back office accounting and reconciliation for service providers like CPO, Network Operator  4) Loyalty program for engagement","whatMakesYourProductUnique":"We use Blockchain Technology and related technology to bring Trust to the ecosystem.","productReadiness":"We are in the process of piloting the platform.
