On average, it takes 60-120 minutes.\r\n\r\nSolution: We reduce the time it takes to create social media posts to just 1-2 minutes with our AI as SaaS\r\n\r\nCurrent status: Tech-enabled service. The AI creates the post & a ghostwriter optimizes it. We charge 490€ / month for 8 posts.\r\n\r\nTraction: 23 paying customers in 3 months, 9.500€ MRR, EXIST, 1.2k sign-ups\r\n\r\nMarket: There are 93 million freelancers and SMEs in Europa and USA. 65 million of them are present on social media. By capturing just 0.12 % of those as active customers, we are looking at 192 million ARR based on 200€ / mo subscriptions.\r\n\r\nFounders:\r\nDr. Thomas Lindemann (CEO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-lindemann/\r\nBenjamin Zengler (COO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/zengler/\r\nLukas Karoff (CTO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-karoff/","problemYouAreSolving":"Creating social media posts is time-consuming. It takes 60-120 minutes to create just one of them. Our AI can do it in less than 2 minutes.","productDescription":"We use artificial intelligence to create nicely structured, easy to read social media posts (text, hashtags, emojis and images)","whatMakesYourProductUnique":"Being present on social media (for lead generation and branding purposes) has never been easier (or cheaper). With our service, social media marketing becomes available by the push of a button.","productReadiness":"We use our AI in the form of a tech-enabled-service. The AI creates the social media post that is then optimized by a real human being before it is delivered to the customer. We sell this service as a monthly subscription. Profit margin is more than 60%.","productRoadMap":"We will launch our new web app that will streamline many processes mid february 2021. Our main focus is to decrease the human factor by increasing the quality of our AI. From a business perspective, in the next 12 months, we focus on growth and revenue, not profit, to prepare for a seed round.","targetMarket":["United States","Austria","Germany","Switzerland"],"marketDrivers":"Being present on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, XING etc. becomes increasingly important - for lead generation & branding purposes.\r\n\r\n70% of all companies already use marketing automation. But the most important part of it, the content generation itself, is still a manual process.\r\n\r\nWe are changing that.\r\n\r\nAlso, more and more companies are looking to turn their employees into \"mini B2B influencers\" on social media - which will create additional need for regular social media content.","marketSize":"192000000 € ARR (0.12 % of SAM)","competition":"Crowdfire\r\nLater\r\nCopy.ai\r\nLately\r\nCanva\r\nAdobe Spark\r\n\r\nAll of those automate PARTS of the post generation process but still require lots of expertise.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no service like us that automates THE WHOLE post generation process. This will surely change soon though.","strengthAgainstCompetitors":"We are faster. We are live. No one else is, yet.\r\n\r\nThat means we already generate data to fuel back into the AI to make it learn faster.\r\n\r\nAlso, we focus on UX first. We believe that only by making social media marketing dead-simple, we can come out on top.","challengesAgainstCompetitors":"It is not important to have an AI that is 3% better than the one of the competition. It is not important to have patents.\r\n\r\nIt is important to grow as fast as possible - much like Zalando for example. To do so, we need to focus on superior customer experience and scalable marketing funnels.","revenueSources":"- Monthly subscription (currently, we charge 490€ / month in your cheapest package, 60%+ margin) -> currently tech-enabled-service, then SaaS\r\n\r\n- Paid Ads that will be handled via our platform (we automate paid services, charge 5% fee. In comparison, marketing agencies charge 15-30% fee).","salesStrategy":"Pricing: Monthly subscription based on how many posts should be generated (NOW: 8 posts for 490€ / month, SAAS: 200€ / month).\r\n\r\nSales: LinkedIn bots, automated funnels, webinar (we do that already, we generate 250+ leads every week for a total of 500€ / month).\r\n\r\nFuture: Referrals, Freebie (our web app [release feb 2021] will feature a free scheduler (like buffer) that we can use to get people in, then upsell them on our paid plans\r\n\r\nLarge accounts: employees as B2B mini influencers","traction":"3 after initial MVP-release\r\n- 23 paying customers\r\n- 9.5k € MRR\r\n- 1.200+ sign-ups\r\n- 60% profit margin\r\n\r\n- EXIST\r\n- top 3 startups of central germany award 2020\r\n- best newcomer startup of the month award 2020 by Startup Bundesverband e.V.","pilotsCustomers":"- 23 paying customers (no family & friends, real customers)\r\n\r\nBusiness Angels\r\n- 2 x ex-mckinsey\r\n- ex. porsche VP\r\n- ex.
