In addition, more than 50% of the trips in the urban environment are less than 5 km and the main mean of transportation is cars. Transporting a 75 kg passenger in a 1500 kg vehicle over a short distance is not sustainable. It is literally transporting metal rather than humans.\r\n\r\nInfinite Mobility is developing light-weight vehicles powered by solar energy adapted for urban mobility. Our vehicle reduces the need/time for recharging by at least 40% and it can even eliminate it in the regions with high solar irradiation. \r\n\r\nOur vision is to develop the next-gen of urban vehicle. Market of solar vehicles is expected to 3B$ globally by 2030. The founding team is made of 3 friends (2 male and a female) that collectively have +30 y experience. Pre-orders secured and a pre-seed fund is under final negociation.","problemYouAreSolving":"The main Market Pain of electric vehicles is the so-called \"range anxiety\".
