Unlike flight and train, bus travellers don’t have the luxury to have a tasty meal during the journey. There are limited places to grab a meal at bus stops and travellers remain hungry on the long journey. Hence, BusDine is starting in Germany and Austria to provide bus stop food delivery service across major long-distance bus routes. \r\n\r\nWe are targeting the intersection of food delivery and the long-distance bus travel market.
