    "whatMakesYourProductUnique": "There’s no central digital hub for learning about the female body. Some people are gaining their knowledge through self-study and scattered sources on the internet. Alternatively people are reading books, learning from their parents or friends.",
    "productReadiness": "Launch of the first courses in Q2 2021. We have built up a tremendously great and supporting community in various channels.",
    "productRoadMap": "Over the course of the year, we will launch a total of five online courses for Generation Y&Z and additional online courses for companies in 2022. Essential in the further development of the Vulvani Academy is the ongoing course expansion. That is why we are opening up as a marketplace by 2023 at the latest. With these measures, the Vulvani Academy has the potential to become a global and scalable center of excellence around the female body.",
    "targetMarket": ["Germany"],
    "marketDrivers": "At the launch of the product, the main risk is that too few B2C customers will be attracted. Topics relating to women&#039;s health must be treated very sensitively to avoid misinformation. Another challenge is high-quality management to ensure the accuracy of the content of the online courses offered (externally and internally). In the medium term, increasing user activity is a crucial factor, since if activity is too low, the affordable prices cannot be maintained.",
    "marketSize": "Potentially 51% of people who identify as female within Generation Y.",
    "competition": "There is no global e-learning marketplace around female health.\r\nPlatforms such as Udemy have many courses in the software area, but offer only limited educatio on female health.\r\nIn terms of content, there are smaller digital course creator. However, these are often expensive and not scalable.",
    "strengthAgainstCompetitors": "We start with German and English and consistently expand the online course and language variety. Our online courses are gamified, fun and break taboos.",
    "challengesAgainstCompetitors": "Since we are still very young, we have to compete against larger platforms that already have a large reach. Even if they only offer very limited online courses on female health.",

    "salesStrategy": "Private individuals pay 29€ per course (based on the price willingness from our\r\nsurvey). Here, however, we are at the lower end of the willingness to pay in order to keep the entry thresholds as low as possible.\r\nFor companies, an annual access for all online courses per employee is 99€ from\r\nten accesses. Parents purchase an annual access for all online courses for their children for 49€ (Generation Alpha typically are the children of Generation Y - Upselling potential).",

In addition to traditional mappers, we can make automatic inventories of valuable assets to improve management and city liveability: trees, pavement quality, traffic signs, street furniture etc can be digitised in order to create more efficient management and ultimately improve urban living.

Unlike flight and train, bus travellers don’t have the luxury to have a tasty meal during the journey. There are limited places to grab a meal at bus stops and travellers remain hungry on the long journey. Hence, BusDine is starting in Germany and Austria to provide bus stop food delivery service across major long-distance bus routes. \r\n\r\nWe are targeting the intersection of food delivery and the long-distance bus travel market. We have the first-mover advantage to capture a high market share.\r\n\r\nShivam (Founder) will be working for the development of the mobile apps required for the project.

With a patented design, Elestor offers a highly scalable product, featuring storage costs/MWh (LCoS) far beyond conventional technologies.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, the Elestor technology can play an important role in green hydrogen production. Its unique system concept allows integration with electrolyzers, which results in a large increase of electrolyser utilization. This reduces the costs for green hydrogen production significantly. \r\nSee: https://innovationorigins.com/elestor-found-the-egg-of-columbus-for-the-efficient-deployment-of-hydrogen/\r\n\r\nElestor has been recognized with several (inter)national Awards, like the European IDTechEx Award Berlin, for ‘Best Development in Storage Technology’, juried by Fraunhofer Institute, Technical University Berlin and Toyota Motors Europe. ",
    "problemYouAreSolving": "Enabling Electricity Storage & Green Hydrogen Production at the lowest possible cost",
    "productDescription": "The worldwide patented Elestor technology is based on the Hydrogen Bromine Flow Battery principle. Selection of this principle and combining it with the choice for hydrogen and bromine forms the key to ultra low-cost electricity storage (LCoS). Due to using hydrogen as active material in the battery, integration with electrolysers is possible, resulting in maximization of electrolyser utilization, and as such, reduced green hydrogen production costs.",
    "whatMakesYourProductUnique": "The Elestor technology offers unrivalled low storage costs per kWh, enabling realization of viable business cases. An exclusive addittional feature is the possibility to integrate the technology with electrolysers, resulting in a large reduction of green hydrogen production costs.",
    "productReadiness": "Elestor started field testing already in 2016, and succesfully finalized a handfull of pilots under realistic conditions. Currently, the 2nd of a series of 4 pre-production systems are manufactured, after which the technology will become commercially available in the 2nd half of 2021.",
    "productRoadMap": "With a proven, extensively tested and validated technology, Elestor is at the verge of launching its products commercially. This is anticipated for the 2nd half of 2021, and for hich the first 2 contracts with large corporates have been signed. To deal with the large demand for Elestor's technolog, the year 2021 will be in the light of production expansion and automation, to - in a few years - build the equivalent of the Lithium Gigawatt factories for Flow Batteries.",

    "marketDrivers": "The main market driver is the urgency to be able to cover long periods of time during which no renewable energy is generated (dunkelflaute). With a large dependency on sun & wind, large stored capacities rather than large powers are needed.\r\nThe possibility to independently define power & capacity, for a max economic solution, is exactly a unique feature of Elestor !\r\n\r\nThe main challenge Elestor faces is : How to scale up the production capacity and automation of production fast enough !?",
    "marketSize": "The global storage market until 2050 is estimated to be @ 100s of billions€",
    "competition": "- The most direct competitor is the Vanadium Redox Flow Battery. This technology has been commercially available since >1 decade, and is as such established.\r\n\r\n- Secondly, Lithium-ion batteries are aggressively deployed for large scale stationary storage of electricity ",
    "strengthAgainstCompetitors": "Vanadium makes it impossible to keep up with competition in &#039;the race to the bottom&#039; of battery prices. Vanadium is per kWh 20x more expensive than hydrogenbromine. \r\n\r\nLithium batteries have a shorter lifetime and higher LCoS. The Elestor reaches storage costs per kWh of 2 to 3x lower than Lithium.\r\n\r\n",
    "challengesAgainstCompetitors": "No real challenge against Vanadium, as they will fade out due to far too high costs. As these are due to chemical costs, this is a fundamental problem. \r\n\r\nThe challenge with Lithium is that the Elestor technology has to scale fast to benefit from the same economy-of- scale as Lithium already has.",
    "revenueSources": "- Sales of electricity storage systems\r\n- Consultancy / feasibility studies\r\n- Grants and Subsidies\r\n- Investors",
    "salesStrategy": "Elestor is to become a large volume prodution company rather than a low volume project organisation. \r\n\r\nTargeted clients are the larger international companies (corporate), who seek cooperaion with innovative companies to support their roadmap, and who have expressed interest in adopting the technology in large quantities.\r\n\r\nPricing is currently based on actual Li-ion prices for large scale storage. \r\nWith scaling, the Elestor technology pricing can potentially be reduced with a factor of 5.  ",
    "traction": "The commercial traction for Elestor&#039;s technology is very high. The challenge is therefore to identify those market segments in which the unique technology features are economically most meaningful.\r\n\r\nThe Elestor technology excels economically wherever large scale, long duration storage is required.",
    "pilotsCustomers": "Pilots have been done at:\r\n- Witteveen+Bos, Deventer\r\n- Welvaarts, Den Dungen\r\n- ITM Group, Kampen\r\n- Gemeentewerf, Emmeloord\r\n\r\n* It is due to strict NDA embargos not possible to mention the company names of the first large clients. Generally, these are large international corporates.\r\n* Battery power/capacity being discussed ranges from 500kW/3000kWh to 25MW/250MWh.\r\n* Most customers are from Europe, in contact for large systems in Australia (SunCable project) and USA (State of Virginia)  ",
    "metrics": "In essence this is the reduction of Levelized Cost of Storage (LCoS), saying what the actual costs are for storing 1 kWh.\r\n\r\nOther technologies show LCoS of €0,12-0,15 (Lithium) and €0,25-0,30 (Lead acid), thus unable to make storage a business cases.\r\n\r\nWith LCoS of € 0,05, Elestor can do this !\r\n     ",

    "segmentFocus": "B2B B2C",
    "industry": "Transportation & Logistics",
    "headquarters": "Germany",
    "startupOverview": "recyclehero was founded in August 2018 in Hamburg. The startup provides a social and sustainable pickup-service who supports restaurants, companies, shops  and private households by disposing recyclable waste (waste glas, waste paper, refundable bottles). The service is carried out by electrified cargo bikes. By today approx. 200 clients (B2B, B2C) in Hamburg are using the service - mostly subscription users. The business model is based on service-fees paid by the customer. The service was launched as a contemporary and time-saving recycling solution for private and business clients; determining the fight against rising traffic emissions and with a strong focus on social change (f.e. recyclehero also runs a homeless aid project called “Straßensuppe&#039;&#039;). The social startup is planning to expand their service in up to two more German cities within the year 2021.  recyclehero was founded by Nadine Herbrich (real estate background) and Alessandro Cocco (finance and banking background).",
    "problemYouAreSolving": "Increase of the recycling quota for recyclable waste. We use electrified cargo bikes to avoid carbon emissions and increase visibility of e-cargo bikes in traffic. Preferably we engage socially & financially disadvantaged people. More ‘quality time’ for our clients.",
    "productDescription": "The pickup can be ordered online - on demand or as subscription. Our heroes (drivers) collect the recyclables with electrified cargo bikes - directly at the client’s door. Disposal of waste glass and paper at recycling bins or recycling yard. Return of refundable bottles in supermarkets.",
    "whatMakesYourProductUnique": "We are the first cargo bike pick up service for recyclable waste in Germany. For our service we use e-cargo bikes only. The bikes can load up until 200 kg. As waste paper/waste glas appear on a regular basis customers often subscribe to our service. Our model is based on profit and social profit.",
    "productReadiness": "By today approx. 200 customers  (B2B, B2C) are using the service. We are focussing on automating some processes e.g. route planning. We own three cargo bikes. Our team consists of three to five drivers. Our pick-up area ranges from Ottensen to Hohenfelde, from Wintherhude to Hafencity.",
    "productRoadMap": "Q1 2021: Further process automation, e.g. route/resource planning and client management and UX/UI optimization Q2 2021: Raising Seed Capital from Business Angels/Accelerators (Creating Marketing Campaign) Q3 2021: Hiring new staff and expansion to two further cities (Frankfurt and Leipzig) - launch marketing campaign, Q4 2021: Expand our service to other recyclables (electronic waste, old clothes); 2022: expansion to 3 to 4 cities (6 - 7 in total); 2023: expansion to 3-4 cities (9-11 in total).",
    "targetMarket": ["Germany"],
    "marketDrivers": "Big drivers are \"Verkehrswende\", zero waste movement and the focus on social and climate action which exactly meets mission and Zeitgeist of recyclehero. Partially also private and public waste companies are our competitors, however we rather focus on cases and clients that are not covered by them for several reasons. The cargo bike logistic infrastructure in Hamburg is developing very slow. e.g. we had difficulties to find micro hub solutions to decentralize our business throughout Hamburg.",
    "marketSize": "2 billion Euro",
    "competition": "Our service is currently only provided by Swiss companies (e.g. Recycling Service or Mr. Green). Some courier services in Hamburg do also offer pickups of waste paper, but for a significant higher price.  ",
    "strengthAgainstCompetitors": "Our business model is based on a modern service for everybody - young WG´s, elderly people, small and medium business. Additionally it provides a good feeling to our customers as they also buy the climate friendly framework. Booking our service also means supporting our social projects and mission.",
    "challengesAgainstCompetitors": "Preferably we dispose the collected recyclables at the recycling yard. Especially in times of Corona these yards where really crowded which led to long waiting situations for our drivers. We do not yet have the possibility to store and sell the recyclables as waste companies do.",
    "revenueSources": "The b-model is based on service fees. For waste glas the base fee is 7,90 € for 20 kg. For waste paper it is 11,90 € for 20 kg. Larger quantities are additionally charged by weight (on demand costs 3,90 € extra). In addition we run company advertisements on our cargo bikes (500 € / bike / month).",
    "salesStrategy": "Almost 100% of our customer inquiries result from inbound marketing, which is basically traceable to our PR & social media activity and SEO. All revenues were achieved without any marketing spendings yet. In 2021 we want to focus on outbound-marketing and begin to carry out our sales strategy. In addition we are working on building a community with focus on recycling and social topics, e.g. to help finance our project Straßensuppe people have the possibility to donate their refundable bottles.",
    "traction": "recyclehero is supporting the idea of circular economy. We define a new level of household and commercial service, carried out in an appropriate and future orientated way. Therebye we touch the topics of traffic turnaround (last mile innovations) and are tackling social problems in a helpful manner.",
    "pilotsCustomers": "About three quarters of our customers are commercial (restaurants, shops, offices). The number of private customers is increasing as it took time to build a reliable and trustworthy brand. In December 2018 we started a three months pilot phase. Most of the clients are still our clients today.",
    "metrics": "Key performance indicators are sales per hour, customer density and efficient routing planning. An average tour has 10 to 15 stops. Besides good route planning the time of packing and disposing in between are essential for this KPI. Density: the shorter the distances the more efficient we are.",

    "howImpact": "Increasing recycling quota for recyclable waste, relief for city traffic by the use of zero emission electrified cargo bikes, more quality time for our customers, low threshold-access into the workforce for financially disadvantaged people. recyclehero was founded in and is Umweltpartner of Hamburg.",
    "whatDegreeSustainability": "The model is based on the 3 pillars of sustainability. Economically: we bootstrapped the company to ensure the necessity of our service.

    "startupOverview": "Companies are wasting money in their manufacturing through inefficient process.  One reason is the lack of understanding of how manufacturing processes are impacting financial KPIs. The market in big data reporting and analysis tools worldwide with 19.6B and 23%. Our vision is to become must have for FP&A departments worldwide and a player for FP&A as Salesforce is for CRM, so that manufacturing companies save tons of jobs with better decision.

There is a waiting list of 8 customers in our pipeline, which would like to get our solution implemented.",
    "problemYouAreSolving": "Poor P&L management is the main reason why companies still have inefficient processes and lose therefore money in manufacturing. Companies overloaded with valueless KPIs and simple and useless forecasting, which is made on gut feeling and poor statistic skills.",
    "productDescription": "Stargazr enables companies to see in which direction their company is heading in the future, using a powerful AI-based software.Our software uses a specific value driver framework which helps controlling to understand their results in real-time. Also, by using features like predictive analytics controlling can predict their figures or using sentiment analytics to understand how the world outside of the companies impact their controlling. ",
    "whatMakesYourProductUnique": "We have built a unique value driver model, which was rolled out in a one-year project at Lufthansa Technik Los Angeles and saved 400 jobs. Based on that framework, we apply techniques like predictive analytics. That framework is unique and essential for the controller to understand the real drivers.",
    "productReadiness": "We developed an MVP for our first pilot customer. We are looking for advice on how to acquire new customers without having the possibility to provide a demonstration on their own data since the integration process is too expensive to provide it as a free trial. tool will be market ready.

    "productRoadMap": "The next step is the integration of the value driver with a forecasting product to obtain accurate predictions from both transactional and operational figures using AI methods. Also, we push towards an integration of SAP-centric ERP workflows through creation of an integration toolbox accessible from the web interface. After focusing on customer acquisition to improve the current set of solutions and broaden the range of formats supported by the autom. integration, our tool will be market ready",

On average, it takes 60-120 minutes.\r\n\r\nSolution: We reduce the time it takes to create social media posts to just 1-2 minutes with our AI as SaaS\r\n\r\nCurrent status: Tech-enabled service. The AI creates the post & a ghostwriter optimizes it. We charge 490€ / month for 8 posts.\r\n\r\nTraction: 23 paying customers in 3 months, 9.500€ MRR, EXIST, 1.2k sign-ups\r\n\r\nMarket: There are 93 million freelancers and SMEs in Europa and USA. 65 million of them are present on social media. By capturing just 0.12 % of those as active customers, we are looking at 192 million ARR based on 200€ / mo subscriptions.\r\n\r\nFounders:\r\nDr. Thomas Lindemann (CEO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-lindemann/\r\nBenjamin Zengler (COO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/zengler/\r\nLukas Karoff (CTO): https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-karoff/",

    "productDescription": "We use artificial intelligence to create nicely structured, easy to read social media posts (text, hashtags, emojis and images)",
    "whatMakesYourProductUnique": "Being present on social media (for lead generation and branding purposes) has never been easier (or cheaper). With our service, social media marketing becomes available by the push of a button.",
    "productReadiness": "We use our AI in the form of a tech-enabled-service. The AI creates the social media post that is then optimized by a real human being before it is delivered to the customer. We sell this service as a monthly subscription. Profit margin is more than 60%.",
    "productRoadMap": "We will launch our new web app that will streamline many processes mid february 2021. Our main focus is to decrease the human factor by increasing the quality of our AI. From a business perspective, in the next 12 months, we focus on growth and revenue, not profit, to prepare for a seed round.",
    "targetMarket": ["United States", "Austria", "Germany", "Switzerland"],
    "marketDrivers": "Being present on platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, XING etc. becomes increasingly important - for lead generation & branding purposes.\r\n\r\n70% of all companies already use marketing automation. But the most important part of it, the content generation itself, is still a manual process.\r\n\r\nWe are changing that.\r\n\r\nAlso, more and more companies are looking to turn their employees into \"mini B2B influencers\" on social media - which will create additional need for regular social media content.",

This will surely change soon though.",
    "strengthAgainstCompetitors": "We are faster. We are live. No one else is, yet.\r\n\r\nThat means we already generate data to fuel back into the AI to make it learn faster.\r\n\r\nAlso, we focus on UX first. We believe that only by making social media marketing dead-simple, we can come out on top.",
    "challengesAgainstCompetitors": "It is not important to have an AI that is 3% better than the one of the competition. It is not important to have patents.\r\n\r\nIt is important to grow as fast as possible - much like Zalando for example. To do so, we need to focus on superior customer experience and scalable marketing funnels.",
    "revenueSources": "- Monthly subscription (currently, we charge 490€ / month in your cheapest package, 60%+ margin) -> currently tech-enabled-service, then SaaS\r\n\r\n- Paid Ads that will be handled via our platform (we automate paid services, charge 5% fee. In comparison, marketing agencies charge 15-30% fee).",
    "salesStrategy": "Pricing: Monthly subscription based on how many posts should be generated (NOW: 8 posts for 490€ / month, SAAS: 200€ / month).\r\n\r\nSales: LinkedIn bots, automated funnels, webinar (we do that already, we generate 250+ leads every week for a total of 500€ / month).\r\n\r\nFuture: Referrals, Freebie (our web app [release feb 2021] will feature a free scheduler (like buffer) that we can use to get people in, then upsell them on our paid plans\r\n\r\nLarge accounts: employees as B2B mini influencers",
